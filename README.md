# The Big To-Do List

* figure out read-only vs full-access (LAN appears to only search for 1 key,
  which is neither of these as far as I can tell)
* known hosts
* encrypt / decrypt message w/ secret ... then session keys
* is my file out of date? ... then fix that


* key generation
* web interface
* uTP (cgo?)
* use secret to get hosts to render web page to read data remotely (web)?

* name ideas: bitlocker, torrsync
